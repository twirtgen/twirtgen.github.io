I am currently a Ph.D. student working on the extensibility of routing protocols
under the supervision of Prof. Olivier Bonaventure at UCLouvain. I currently work
on techniques to improve the programmability of BGP, which led to the first xBGP prototype.

My research interests include, but are not limited to, distributed routing protocols,
programmable networks and system architecture.
